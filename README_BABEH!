Allan: I recommend reading the documentations at the top of each file for
easier code reading. Also, I removed the student data and only retained
the course data because the sql dump is too big for you to download. The
course table only has 500+ rows

Fred: coursedesc data @ https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8uzdX41KxwGd0R4a2xhTzlGX1U
